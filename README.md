# Open Esport 2025

[ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Version FranÃ§aise : ](README_fr.md)

## Description

**Open Esport 2025** is an open source competitive FPS project developed with the **Godot 4** engine. It aims to provide a modular, extensible, and easily deployable foundation for creating modern esport experiences.

The primary goal is to offer a **self-hosted** and **autonomous infrastructure**, independent from traditional publishers, in order to bypass limitations or policy changes imposed for commercial purposes.  
The project is designed to be **compatible with modern deployment environments** (Docker, Kubernetes, PaaS like Fly.io, Railway, or IaaS like AWS, GCP, Azure), while remaining lightweight and easy to host locally.

This solution is intended for developers, tournament organizers, open source communities, and anyone wishing to create, manage, and evolve a free, transparent, and sovereign esport platform.

- Functional main menu
